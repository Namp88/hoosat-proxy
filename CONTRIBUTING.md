## Style Guide

### TypeScript Style

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow existing code style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Use English for all comments and documentation

### Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add endpoint for getting mempool size
fix: correct balance calculation for coinbase transactions
docs: update API documentation for address endpoints
```

### Code Structure

When adding new endpoints:

1. Create DTO files in `src/modules/[module]/dto/`
2. Add validation decorators to DTOs
3. Update controller with proper Swagger decorators
4. Add comprehensive examples in Swagger
5. Update README.md if adding new features

Example controller method:
```typescript
@Get('example')
@ApiOperation({ 
  summary: 'Short description',
  description: 'Detailed description of what this endpoint does'
})
@ApiResponse({ 
  status: 200, 
  description: 'Success response description',
  schema: {
    example: {
      success: true,
      data: { /* example data */ }
    }
  }
})
async exampleMethod() {
  return this.service.exampleMethod();
}
```

## Adding a New Endpoint

1. Determine which module the endpoint belongs to
2. Create DTO if needed in `dto/` folder
3. Add method to controller with:
    - Proper HTTP decorator (`@Get`, `@Post`, etc)
    - Swagger decorators (`@ApiOperation`, `@ApiResponse`)
    - Validation decorators on parameters
4. Use `ClientService` to call SDK methods
5. Test the endpoint
6. Update documentation
